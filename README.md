**TASK1** 

Project Description:

This is a simple Python program that checks whether a number entered by the user is even or odd.
It helps beginners understand user input, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations in Python.

How the Program Works:

The program asks the user to enter a number.
The entered value is converted into an integer and stored in variable num.
The program checks whether the number is divisible by 2.
If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd.
The result is printed on the screen.

Features:

✅ Takes input from the user
✅ Uses conditional (if-else) statements
✅ Uses modulus operator (%)
✅ Beginner-friendly logic

**TASK2**

Project Description

This is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.
It demonstrates the use of variables, loops, and formatted output in Python.

How the Program Works:

A variable total is initialized with value 0.
A loop runs from 1 to 50.
Each number is added to total.
The final sum is printed.

Features

✅ Uses for loop
✅ Demonstrates range() function
✅ Uses variable accumulation
✅ Displays result using f-string formatting
✅ Beginner-friendly Python program
